This data set is real data anonymized from a NIH funded study looking a cognitive function related reported and diagnosised medical condition.  There are some missing variables and skewness that will need to be addressed.   

Background and source of data  
The data set so graciously provided was generated by Drs. Sid O’Bryant and Leigh Johnson from the Institute for Translation Research (ITR) at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, Texas. The data provided is a subset of the Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study.   The HABLE study was designed to investigate biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction, depression-related cognitive dysfunction, the impact of metabolic factors on cognitive abilities, and cognitive correlates of environmental contaminants in Latino elders in a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in Ft. Worth and surrounding community of Tarrant County, Texas. (site) 
The HABLE study in its entirety appeared to be too large and complex given the time frame to complete this course project.   The original study data set consisted of almost 750 individuals each with over 1700 separate variables. To make the project manageable the data was subset to include only research participants’ clinical labs, residential history (subset), physical and mental activity, diabetes management information, along with other data elements.
